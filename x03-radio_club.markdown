## Overview

The University of Victoria Experimental Radio Group, is a [RAC affiliated](https://www.rac.ca/affiliated-club-listing/) Amateur radio club at the University of Victoria, sponsored by Prof. Peter Driessen VE7AB, the Principal Investigator of the UVic Propagation Laboratory. Using the call [VE7XUV](https://www.qrz.com/db/VE7XUV), the group focuses on facilitating Amateur radio training and education by introducing students to this activity early in their professional careers, and using Amateur radio to enhance the quality of their education experience.

As the official Amateur radio club of the University of Victoria, membership is welcome by students, staff and faculty members, as well as experienced Amateur radio operators in Victoria who have time and expertise to offer to aid with implementing the main mission of the Club - student training. Personnel interested in joining the Club are encouraged to visit during its weekly meeting, outlined below. There is no need to make prior arrangements for a visit - drop-ins are welcome.

## Equipment

The equipment operated by the Club consist of two state of the art operating positions, shown below. One is designed to facilitate HF contesting (K4 Station), while the other student training via operation in the HF, VHF and UHF part of the radio spectrum, as well as OSCAR satellite work (Flex Station). The station is built to be versatelite and maximize the educational potential, while respecting the boundaries of what is feasible within the constrains of a university campus.
